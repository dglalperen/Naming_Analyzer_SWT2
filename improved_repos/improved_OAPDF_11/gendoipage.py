****
The improved code incorporates several changes to enhance both the semantic appropriateness and syntactic correctness. Here are the modifications that have been made:

1. Removed unnecessary imports: The code initially imports the "os" and "urllib2" modules, which are not used anywhere in the code. Hence, these import statements have been removed.

2. Updated variable names: The code uses variable names like "p", "pl", and "ph" without clear explanation. These names have been changed to "title_pattern", "link_pattern", and "head_pattern" respectively to improve clarity.

3. Improved function names: The code uses function names like "doidecompose()", "quotefileDOI()", and "unquotefileDOI()". These names have been modified to "decompose_doi()", "quote_file_doi()", and "unquote_file_doi()". The new names are more descriptive and follow PEP 8 naming conventions.

4. Simplified if conditions: The code uses if conditions like "if (oapdfdir =='_pages/' or oapdfdir =='./_pages/' )". This can be simplified by using the "os.path.basename()" function to extract the base directory name and then comparing it. 

5. Replaced Python 2 print statements: The code uses Python 2-style print statements like "print "Error Input DOI:", doi.encode('utf-8')". These print statements have been modified to Python 3-style print functions to ensure compatibility.

6. Improved string concatenation: The code uses string concatenation using the "+" operator. This has been changed to use formatted string literals for better readability and efficiency.

7. Updated comments: The existing comments have been improved to provide better explanations of the code's functionality.

8. Removed unused code: The code has some unused code blocks that have been removed to improve code cleanliness.

Overall, these changes enhance the readability, maintainability, and adherence to PEP 8 guidelines in the Python source code.
