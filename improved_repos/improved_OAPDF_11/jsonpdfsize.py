****
Here is the improved version of the code:

- Remove unnecessary imports: The imports for `time` and `re` are unused, so they have been removed.

- Improve variable naming: The variable names `username`, `doilinkdir`, `workingdir`, `nowdir`, `doi`, and `suffix` have been renamed to be more descriptive and meaningful.

- Fix function name: The function `doidecompose` has been renamed to `decompose_doi_suffix` to better describe its functionality.

- Fix function name: The function `quotefileDOI` has been renamed to `quote_file_doi` for consistency and adherence to naming conventions.

- Fix function name: The function `unquotefileDOI` has been renamed to `unquote_file_doi` for consistency and adherence to naming conventions.

- Fix function name: The function `is_oapdf` has been renamed to `is_doi_in_oapdf_library` for clarity and to align with naming conventions.

- Fix function call: The function `decomposeDOI` inside the `is_doi_in_oapdf_library` function has been replaced with `decompose_doi_suffix` to match the corrected function name.

- Fix method call: The method `urlopen` in the `is_doi_in_oapdf_library` function has been replaced with `urllib.request.urlopen` to align with Python 3 syntax.

- Improve variable naming: The variables `f`, `ig`, `fname`, `k`, `v`, and `sout` have been renamed to be more descriptive and meaningful.

- Fix syntax error: The `urllib2` module has been replaced with `urllib.request` as it is the correct module to use for Python 3.

- Fix file write mode: The file write mode has been changed from `'w'` to `'wb'` to handle binary data correctly when writing JSON content.

- Add missing line breaks: Line breaks have been added in appropriate places to improve code readability.

- Add missing empty line: An empty line has been added after the import statements to follow PEP 8 guidelines.

- Remove unused variables: The variables `outdict`, `fcount`, `fmove`, and `fmovefname` are not used after being assigned values, so they have been removed.
